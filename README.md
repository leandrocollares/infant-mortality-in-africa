# Infant mortality in Africa

An interactive choropleth map that shows infant mortality rates in Africa. The slider allows users to see how infant mortality rates in Africa varied between 1960 and 2018. Hovering over a country causes a tooltip containing the infant mortality rate for the chosen year to be displayed.

The visualization was implemented with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/). React renders visualization components, whereas D3 handles data and axis calculations. Thanks to React Hooks, only functional
components were employed. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
